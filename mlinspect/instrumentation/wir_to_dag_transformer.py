        If we store the annotations of analyzers in a map until the next operator needs it, we need some
        way to identify them and know when we can delete them. When e.g., there is a raw_data.dropna, it needs
        to know that the previous operator was the pd.read_csv. Then it can load the annotations from a map.
        Afterwards, the annotations need to be deleted from the map to avoid unnecessary overhead.
        While we might store the annotations directly in the data frame in the case of pandas, in the case of
        sklearn that is probably not easily possible.
